## Project Objective

The requirements of the project are as follows:
<ul>
<li>A TRello board (or similar Kanban board technology) with full task expansion to complete the project.</li>
<li>An application that is fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch architecture, then created using a Continuous Integration server and distributed to a cloud-based virtual machine..</li>
<li>If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application.</li>
<li>The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.</li>
<li>The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.</li>
<li>As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.</li>
<li>To make your application accessible to the user, you'll need to employ a reverse proxy.</li>
</ul>
